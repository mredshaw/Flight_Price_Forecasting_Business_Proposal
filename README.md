# Flight Price Forecasting Business Proposal

## Project Overview
The objective of this group project is to identify opportunities for implementing machine learning within a chosen business context, specifically focusing on flight price forecasting. The project involves identifying data requirements, proposing machine learning models, developing a business case, and crafting a compelling pitch document.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Adjusted_Flight_Price_Time_Series.csv

## Requirements

### Opportunity Identification
- Explore the current state of the business (e.g., an app, website, or brick and mortar business).
- Identify specific areas or processes where machine learning could add value.
- Justify why machine learning is the right solution.

### Data Requirement and Collection
- Enumerate the types of data needed and create a sample dataset.
- Describe the data collection, storage, and preprocessing steps.
- Discuss potential issues and ethical considerations related to data or the model.

### Model Selection
- Propose machine learning models that could potentially solve the problem.
- Justify the appropriateness of these models.
- Detail the validation and evaluation methods for the models.

### Business Case Development
- Outline the projected costs of implementing the proposal, considering data availability and computation requirements.
- Estimate the potential ROI (Return on Investment).
- Discuss risks and mitigation strategies.

### Pitch Document and Supporting Artifacts
- Create a compelling pitch document (10-15 slides) summarizing the proposal.
- Generate supporting artifacts like data samples, pseudo-code, or a prototype model.

## Deliverables
- A Jupyter Notebook containing all code and analysis
- A pitch document (PowerPoint presentation)
- Supporting artifacts (e.g., data samples, pseudo-code, prototype model)

## Contents
- `Flight_Price_Forecasting_Business_Proposal.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis, including opportunity identification, data requirements, model selection, business case development, and supporting artifacts.
